        <h4>Welcome!</h4>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Tommie Altvater, and the following is a website containing my experiences, education and projects of the last three years of college.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to be a brief review of my experiences and work during the three years I have spent at the University of Missouri. 
            I hope you gain a better understanding of who I am and what I spend my time doing. 
            There will be a breakdown of my different hobbies and passions outside of work and school as well as academic projects, such as large dataset statistical analysis that I have completed. 
            Along with projects, a survey of my work experiences will be included to uncover skills and abilities I have gained aside from my academics. After examining the information presented in the following pages, 
            I believe you will have an idea of who I am. I hope you see that I am someone who intertwines their passions with the work I choose to do and that I am not someone who limits themself into one categorical box, 
            but rather diversifies the people I spend my time with as well as the things I spend my time doing.
