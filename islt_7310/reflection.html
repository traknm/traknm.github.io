            <p>
            have become the definition of breadth of knowledge during my time at Mizzou. 
            I started my freshman year as an undecided Journalism major and by the end of my first year 
            I was a Secondary History Education Major. This was me settling. I loved history and still do, 
            but I really switch to it because I didn’t know what else to do so I fell into the indecision 
            trap of maybe I’ll just teach High School and coach sports. But then over the Summer I took a 
            chance and switched to Economics. </p>
            
            <p class="tab">At the time, I had no idea what Economics was but I did know that every book 
            I read about modern sports front office business was littered with “outsiders” 
            who came in with degrees in Economics. In books like Moneyball and Astroball, smart 
            people finding success in sports by finding new ways to win using statistics and 
            economic decision making. I took my first Economics class in the Fall of 2020 and 
            loved it. I ended up adding a statistics minor, which ended up being a double major, 
            later that semester. Along the way I also had the room to pick up a certificate in IT 
            to further expand my skillset and digital toolbox.</p>
            
            <p class="tab">The main goal of collecting all of these degrees is to give myself as many options as 
            possible after graduation. I have had many different career paths cross my mind in the 
            last two years. I may still get a teaching certificate and teach and coach at a high school 
            or possibly travel abroad and find remote jobs and travel around. Statistics may open doors 
            for doing data analysis remotely from anywhere in the world I would like. </p>
            
            <p class="tab">For now, I have been working on one singular track. My goal is to graduate Spring 2023 and 
            pursue a career in some type of sports roll, whether it be continuing my roll in the equipment 
            room or finding an introductory job in a front office somewhere that will take me. I have it 
            fully set in my mind that no matter where I go in the sports world, I am going to have to work 
            for free at first to get my foot in the door and build a real opportunity for myself. 
            All I am looking for now is for someone to crack the door open for me somewhere.
