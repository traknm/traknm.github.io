    My name is Tommie Altvater and I am a junior at the University of Missouri. I am studying Economics and Statistics with an emphasis in Sports Analytics. I am also pursuing a certificate in Information Technology. I am originally from Kearney, Missouri which is a town North of Kansas City. I donâ€™t have any experience when it comes to web design, but HTML and CSS will be my fourth and fifth coding language, so I am excited to add to my skillset. Sports are very important to me and I tend to plan my life around a multitude of different athletic events. My favorites are football, baseball and soccer, but I enjoy any type of competition. Along with that I love board games or just anything where you have to use strategy to win. I currently work for the Mizzou Football team as an equipment manager which is a lot of fun but very time consuming. I spent the last two years working for the Rec here at Mizzou in the Aquatic Center.
